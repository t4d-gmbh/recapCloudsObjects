```{admonition} Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
:class: tip


{% if slide %}
**Core Concept:**
* The management and provisioning of computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.
* Replaces physical hardware configuration and interactive graphical interfaces (GUIs).

**Architectural Advantages:**
* **Strict Reproducibility:** Infrastructural states are codified into version-controlled text files.
* **Auditability:** Infrastructure modifications are tracked via standard Git workflows.
* **Consistency:** Eliminates the risk of manual configuration drift across disparate deployment environments.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is defined as the management and provisioning of computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive graphical interfaces.
By codifying infrastructural states into version-controlled text files, deployment environments are rendered strictly reproducible and auditable, thereby eliminating the risk of manual configuration drift.
